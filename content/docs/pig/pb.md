## Quick Start

```bash
# View backup info
pig pb info                          # Show all backup info
pig pb info -o json                  # JSON format output
pig pb ls                            # List all backups
pig pb ls repo                       # List configured repos
pig pb ls stanza                     # List all stanzas

# Create backup (must run on primary)
pig pb backup                        # Auto mode: full if none, else incr
pig pb backup full                   # Full backup
pig pb backup diff                   # Differential backup
pig pb backup incr                   # Incremental backup

# Restore (PITR)
pig pb restore                       # Restore to latest (end of WAL)
pig pb restore -I                    # Restore to backup consistency point
pig pb restore -t "2025-01-01 12:00:00+08"  # Restore to specific time
pig pb restore -n savepoint          # Restore to named restore point

# Stanza management
pig pb create                        # Initialize stanza
pig pb upgrade                       # Upgrade stanza after PG major upgrade
pig pb check                         # Verify repository integrity

# Cleanup
pig pb expire                        # Clean up per retention policy
pig pb expire --dry-run              # Dry run mode
```


## Global Options

These options apply to all `pig pb` subcommands:

| Option | Short | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--stanza` | `-s` | pgBackRest stanza name (auto-detected) |
| `--config` | `-c` | Config file path |
| `--repo` | `-r` | Repository number (multi-repo scenario) |
| `--dbsu` | `-U` | Database superuser (default: `$PIG_DBSU` or `postgres`) |
{.full-width}

**Stanza Auto-Detection:**

If `-s` not specified, pig auto-detects stanza name from config file:

1. Read config file (default `/etc/pgbackrest/pgbackrest.conf`)
2. Find sections not starting with `[global*]`
3. Use first stanza found

If config has multiple stanzas, a warning is issued and first one is used. Explicitly specify `--stanza` in this case.

**Multi-Repo Support:**

pgBackRest supports multiple repositories (repo1, repo2, etc.). Use `-r` to specify target repo:

```bash
pig pb backup -r 1                   # Backup to repo1
pig pb backup -r 2                   # Backup to repo2
pig pb info -r 2                     # View repo2 backup info
```

## Backup Commands

### pb backup

Create physical backup. Backups can only run on primary instance.

```bash
pig pb backup                        # Auto mode
pig pb backup full                   # Full backup
pig pb backup diff                   # Differential backup
pig pb backup incr                   # Incremental backup
pig pb backup --force                # Skip primary role check
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--force` | `-f` | Skip primary role check |
{.full-width}

**Backup Types:**

| diff | Differential: changes since last full backup |
| incr | Incremental: changes since last any backup |
{.full-width}

**Primary Check:**

Before backup, command auto-checks if current instance is primary. If replica, command exits with error. Use `--force` to skip this check.


### pb expire

Clean up expired backups and WAL archives per retention policy.

```bash
pig pb expire                        # Clean up per policy
pig pb expire --set 20250101-*       # Delete specific backup set

```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `--set` | Delete specific backup set |
| `--dry-run` | Dry run: only display what would be deleted |
{.full-width}

**Retention Policy:**

Configured in `pgbackrest.conf`:

```ini
[global]
repo1-retention-full=2               # Full backups to retain
repo1-retention-diff=4               # Differential backups to retain

| Time only | `12:00:00` | Auto-completes to today (local timezone) |
{.full-width}

**Restore Flow:**

1. Validate parameters and environment
2. Check PostgreSQL is stopped
3. Display restore plan, wait for confirmation (5-second countdown)
4. Execute pgbackrest restore
5. Provide post-restore guidance

**Important:** Stop PostgreSQL before restore:

```bash
pig pg stop                          # Stop PostgreSQL
pig pb restore -t "..."              # Execute restore
pig pg start                         # Start PostgreSQL
```


## Stanza Management Commands

### pb create

Initialize new stanza. Must run before first backup.

```bash
pig pb create                        # Create stanza
pig pb create --no-online            # Create when PostgreSQL not running
pig pb create --force                # Force create
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--no-online` | | Create when PostgreSQL not running |
| `--force` | `-f` | Force create |
{.full-width}


### pb upgrade

Update stanza after PostgreSQL major version upgrade.

```bash
pig pb upgrade                       # Upgrade stanza
pig pb upgrade --no-online           # Upgrade when PostgreSQL not running
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `--no-online` | Upgrade when PostgreSQL not running |
{.full-width}

**Use Case:**

After PostgreSQL major version upgrade (e.g., 16 -> 17), run this command to update stanza metadata.


### pb delete

Delete stanza and all its backups.

```bash
pig pb delete --force                # Delete stanza (requires --force)
pig pb delete --force --yes          # Skip countdown confirmation
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--force` | `-f` | Confirm delete (required) |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip countdown confirmation |
{.full-width}

**Warning:** This is a **destructive and irreversible** operation! All backups will be permanently deleted.

Multiple safety mechanisms:
1. Must provide `--force` parameter
2. 5-second countdown (press Ctrl+C to cancel)
3. Use `--yes` to skip countdown


## Control Commands

### pb check

Verify backup repository integrity and configuration.

```bash
pig pb check                         # Verify repository
```

This command checks:
- WAL archive configuration correctness
- Repository accessibility
- Stanza configuration validity


### pb start

Enable pgBackRest operations.

```bash
pig pb start                         # Enable operations
```

Use after `pb stop` to resume normal operations.


### pb stop

Disable pgBackRest operations (for maintenance).

```bash
pig pb stop                          # Disable operations
pig pb stop --force                  # Terminate running operations
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--force` | `-f` | Terminate running operations |
{.full-width}

**Use Case:**

During system maintenance, use this command to prevent new backup operations from starting.


## Log Commands

### pb log

View pgBackRest log files. Log directory is `/pg/log/pgbackrest/`.

```bash
pig pb log                           # List log files
pig pb log list                      # List log files
pig pb log tail                      # Real-time view latest log
pig pb log tail -n 100               # Show last 100 lines and follow
pig pb log cat                       # Show latest log content
pig pb log cat -n 50                 # Show last 50 lines
pig pb log cat pg-meta-backup.log    # Show specific log file
```

**Subcommands:**

| Subcommand | Aliases | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| list | ls | List log files |
| tail | follow, f | Real-time follow latest log |
| cat | show | Show log content |
{.full-width}

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `--lines` | `-n` | 50 | Number of lines to show |
{.full-width}

**Permission Handling:**

If current user lacks permission to read log directory, command auto-retries with `sudo`.


## Design Notes

**Command Execution:**

All `pig pb` commands execute as database superuser (DBSU). This is because pgBackRest needs access to PostgreSQL data files and WAL archives.

Execution logic:
- If current user is DBSU: execute directly
- If current user is root: use `su - postgres -c "..."` to execute
- Other users: use `sudo -inu postgres -- ...` to execute

**Relationship with pgbackrest:**

`pig pb` is not a complete wrapper of `pgbackrest`, but a higher-level abstraction for common operations:

- Auto-detect stanza name, no need to specify each time
- Auto-check primary role before backup
- Display plan and require confirmation before restore
- Provide user-friendly time format input
- Provide post-restore guidance

For full `pgbackrest` functionality, use `pgbackrest` command directly.

**Default Configuration Paths:**

| Config | Default |
|:---|:---|
| Config file | `/etc/pgbackrest/pgbackrest.conf` |
| Log directory | `/pg/log/pgbackrest` |
| Data directory | `pg1-path` from config, or `$PGDATA` env, or `/pg/data` |
{.full-width}

**Security Considerations:**

- `pb delete` requires `--force` confirmation, with 5-second countdown
- `pb restore` displays restore plan, with 5-second countdown confirmation
- `pb backup` checks primary role by default, prevents running on replica
- Log command filename parameter filters paths to prevent path traversal attacks

**Platform Support:**

This command is designed for Linux systems, depends on Pigsty default directory structure.
