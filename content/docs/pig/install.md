## Script Installation

The simplest way to install `pig` is to run the following installation script:

**Default Installation** (Cloudflare CDN):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/pig | bash
```

**China Mirror**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.cc/pig | bash
```

This script downloads the latest `pig` RPM/DEB package from the Pigsty [software repository](/docs/repo/) and installs it using `rpm` or `dpkg`.


## Specify Version

You can specify a particular version to install by passing the version number as an argument:

**Default Installation** (Cloudflare CDN):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.io/pig | bash -s 0.9.0
```

**China Mirror**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://repo.pigsty.cc/pig | bash -s 0.9.0
```


## Download from Release Page

You can also download `pig` installation packages (`RPM`/`DEB`/tarball) directly from the Pigsty repository: [GitHub Latest Release Page](https://github.com/pgsty/pig/releases/latest)

```

```

After extracting, place the binary file in your system PATH.


## Repository Installation

The `pig` software is located in the [`pigsty-infra`](/docs/repo/infra/) repository. You can add this repository to your operating system and then install using the OS package manager:

### YUM

For RHEL, RockyLinux, CentOS, Alma Linux, OracleLinux, and other EL distributions:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/pigsty-infra.repo > /dev/null <<-'EOF'
[pigsty-infra]
name=Pigsty Infra for $basearch
baseurl=https://repo.pigsty.io/yum/infra/$basearch
enabled = 1
gpgcheck = 0
module_hotfixes=1
EOF

sudo yum makecache;
sudo yum install -y pig
```

### APT

For Debian, Ubuntu, and other DEB distributions:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pigsty-infra.list > /dev/null <<EOF
deb [trusted=yes] https://repo.pigsty.io/apt/infra generic main
EOF

sudo apt update;
sudo apt install -y pig
```


## Update

To upgrade an existing `pig` version to the latest available version, use the following command:

```bash
pig update            # Upgrade pig itself to the latest version
```

To update the extension data of an existing `pig` to the latest available version, use the following command:

```bash
pig ext reload        # Update pig extension data to the latest version
```


## Uninstall

```bash
apt remove -y pig     # Debian / Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems
yum remove -y pig     # RHEL / CentOS / RockyLinux and other EL distributions
rm -rf /usr/bin/pig   # If installed directly from binary, just delete the binary file
```


## Build from Source

You can also build `pig` yourself. `pig` is developed in Go and is very easy to build. The source code is hosted at [github.com/pgsty/pig](https://github.com/pgsty/pig)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pgsty/pig.git; cd pig
go get -u; go build
```

All RPM/DEB packages are automatically built through GitHub CI/CD workflow using goreleaser.
