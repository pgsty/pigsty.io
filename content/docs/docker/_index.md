[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the most popular containerization platform, providing standardized software delivery capabilities.

**Pigsty does not rely on Docker to deploy any of its components; instead, it provides the ability to deploy and install Docker** — this is an **optional module**.

Pigsty offers a series of [Docker software/tool/application templates](/docs/app/) for you to choose from as needed.
This allows users to quickly spin up various containerized stateless software templates, adding extra functionality.
You can use external, Pigsty-managed highly available database clusters while placing stateless applications inside containers.

Pigsty's Docker module automatically configures accessible registry mirrors for users in mainland China to improve image pulling speed (and availability).
You can easily configure Registry and Proxy settings to flexibly access different image sources.
