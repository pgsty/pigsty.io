> Source: [pgBackRest Command Docs: archive-push](https://pgbackrest.org/command.html#command-archive-push)

Accepts a WAL segment from PostgreSQL and archives it in each repository defined by the indexed `repo-path` option (see the [Repository](/docs/pgbackrest/configuration/#repository-options) section for information on configuring repositories). The WAL segment may be pushed immediately to the archive or stored locally depending on the value of `archive-async`. With multiple repositories configured, `archive-push` will attempt to push to as many repositories as possible.

The `archive-push` is intended to be configured and called by PostgreSQL. See [Configure Archiving](/docs/pgbackrest/user-guide/#configure-archiving) for an example.

## Command Options

### Asynchronous Archiving Option (`--archive-async`)

Push/get WAL segments asynchronously.

Enables asynchronous operation for the `archive-push` and `archive-get` commands.

Asynchronous operation is more efficient because it can reuse connections and take advantage of parallelism. See the `spool-path`, `archive-get-queue-max`, and `archive-push-queue-max` options for more information.

```yaml
default: n
example: --archive-async
```

### Check Archive Option (`--archive-check`)

Check that WAL segments are in the archive before backup completes.

Checks that all WAL segments required to make the backup consistent are present in the WAL archive. It's a good idea to leave this as the default unless you are using another method for archiving.

This option must be enabled if `archive-copy` is enabled.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-archive-check
```

### Check Archive Mode Option (`--archive-mode-check`)

Check the PostgreSQL `archive_mode` setting.

Enabled by default, this option disallows PostgreSQL `archive_mode=always`.

WAL segments pushed from a standby server might be logically the same as WAL segments pushed from the primary but have different checksums. Disabling archiving from multiple sources is recommended to avoid conflicts.

CAUTION:

If this option is disabled then it is critical to ensure that only one archiver is writing to the repository via the `archive-push` command.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-archive-mode-check
```

### Maximum Archive Push Queue Size Option (`--archive-push-queue-max`)

Maximum size of the PostgreSQL archive queue.

After the limit is reached, the following will happen:

- pgBackRest will notify PostgreSQL that the WAL was successfully archived, then **DROP IT**.
- A warning will be output to the PostgreSQL log.

If this occurs then the archive log stream will be interrupted and PITR will not be possible past that point. A new backup will be required to regain full restore capability.

In asynchronous mode the entire queue will be dropped to prevent spurts of WAL getting through before the queue limit is exceeded again.

The purpose of this feature is to prevent the log volume from filling up at which point PostgreSQL will stop completely. Better to lose the backup than have PostgreSQL go down.

```yaml
allowed: [0B, 4PiB]
example: --archive-push-queue-max=1TiB
```

Deprecated Name: archive-queue-max

### Archive Timeout Option (`--archive-timeout`)

Archive timeout.

Set maximum time, in seconds, to wait for each WAL segment to reach the pgBackRest archive repository. The timeout applies to the `check` and `backup` commands when waiting for WAL segments required for backup consistency to be archived.

```yaml
default: 1m
allowed: [100ms, 1d]
example: --archive-timeout=30
```

## General Options

### Buffer Size Option (`--buffer-size`)

Buffer size for I/O operations.

Buffer size used for copy, compress, encrypt, and other operations. The number of buffers used depends on options and each operation may use additional memory, e.g. `gz` compression may use an additional 256KiB of memory.

Allowed values are `16KiB`, `32KiB`, `64KiB`, `128KiB`, `256KiB`, `512KiB`, `1MiB`, `2MiB`, `4MiB`, `8MiB`, and `16MiB`.

```yaml
default: 1MiB
example: --buffer-size=2MiB
```

### pgBackRest Command Option (`--cmd`)

pgBackRest command.

pgBackRest may generate a command string, e.g. when the `restore` command generates the restore_command setting. The command used to run the pgBackRest process will be used in this case unless the `cmd` option is provided.

CAUTION:

Wrapping the pgBackRest command may cause unpredictable behavior and is not recommended.

```yaml
default: [path of executed pgbackrest binary]
example: --cmd=/var/lib/pgsql/bin/pgbackrest_wrapper.sh
```

### SSH Client Command Option (`--cmd-ssh`)

SSH client command.

Use a specific SSH client command when an alternate is desired or the `ssh` command is not in $PATH.

```yaml
default: ssh
example: --cmd-ssh=/usr/bin/ssh
```

### Compress Option (`--compress`)

Use file compression.

Backup files are compatible with command-line compression tools.

This option is now deprecated. The `compress-type` option should be used instead.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-compress
```

### Compress Level Option (`--compress-level`)

File compression level.

Sets the level to be used for file compression when `compress-type` does not equal `none` or `compress=y` (deprecated).

```yaml
default (depending on compress-type):
   bz2 - 9
   gz - 6
   lz4 - 1
   zst - 3

allow range (depending on compress-type):
   bz2 - [1, 9]
   gz - [-1, 9]
   lz4 - [-5, 12]
   zst - [-7, 22]

example: --compress-level=9
```

### Network Compress Level Option (`--compress-level-network`)

Network compression level.

Sets the network compression level when `compress-type=none` and the command is not run on the same host as the repository. Compression is used to reduce network traffic. When `compress-type` does not equal `none` the `compress-level-network` setting is ignored and `compress-level` is used instead so that the file is only compressed once.

```yaml
default: 1
allowed: [-5, 12]
example: --compress-level-network=1
```

### Compress Type Option (`--compress-type`)

File compression type.

The following compression types are supported:

- `none` - no compression
- `bz2` - bzip2 compression format
- `gz` - gzip compression format
- `lz4` - lz4 compression format (not available on all platforms)
- `zst` - Zstandard compression format (not available on all platforms)

```yaml
default: gz
example: --compress-type=none
```

### Config Option (`--config`)

pgBackRest configuration file.

Use this option to specify a different configuration file than the default.

```yaml
default: CFGOPTDEF_CONFIG_PATH "/" PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
example: --config=/conf/pgbackrest/pgbackrest.conf
```

### Config Include Path Option (`--config-include-path`)

Path to additional pgBackRest configuration files.

Configuration files existing in the specified location with extension `.conf` will be concatenated with the pgBackRest configuration file, resulting in one configuration file.

```yaml
default: CFGOPTDEF_CONFIG_PATH "/" PROJECT_CONFIG_INCLUDE_PATH
example: --config-include-path=/conf/pgbackrest/conf.d
```

### Config Path Option (`--config-path`)

Base path of pgBackRest configuration files.

This setting is used to override the default base path setting for the `--config` and `--config-include-path` options unless they are explicitly set on the command-line.

For example, passing only `--config-path=/conf/pgbackrest` results in the `--config` default being set to `/conf/pgbackrest/pgbackrest.conf` and the `--config-include-path` default being set to `/conf/pgbackrest/conf.d`.

```yaml
default: CFGOPTDEF_CONFIG_PATH
example: --config-path=/conf/pgbackrest
```

### I/O Timeout Option (`--io-timeout`)

I/O timeout.

Timeout, in seconds, used for connections and read/write operations.

Note that the entire read/write operation does not need to complete within this timeout but *some* progress must be made, even if it is only a single byte.

```yaml
default: 1m
allowed: [100ms, 1h]
example: --io-timeout=120
```

### Lock Path Option (`--lock-path`)

Path where lock files are stored.

The lock path provides a location for pgBackRest to create lock files to prevent conflicting operations from being run concurrently.

```yaml
default: /tmp/pgbackrest
example: --lock-path=/backup/db/lock
```

### Neutral Umask Option (`--neutral-umask`)

Use a neutral umask.

Sets the umask to 0000 so modes in the repository are created in a sensible way. The default directory mode is 0750 and default file mode is 0640. The lock and log directories set the directory and file mode to 0770 and 0660 respectively.

To use the executing user's umask instead specify `neutral-umask=n` in the config file or `--no-neutral-umask` on the command line.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-neutral-umask
```

### Set Process Priority Option (`--priority`)

Set process priority.

Defines how much priority (i.e. niceness) will be given to the process by the kernel scheduler. Positive values decrease priority and negative values increase priority. In most case processes do not have permission to increase their priority.

```yaml
allowed: [-20, 19]
example: --priority=19
```

### Process Maximum Option (`--process-max`)

Max processes to use for compress/transfer.

Each process will perform compression and transfer to make the command run faster, but don't set `process-max` so high that it impacts database performance.

```yaml
default: 1
allowed: [1, 999]
example: --process-max=4
```

### Protocol Timeout Option (`--protocol-timeout`)

Protocol timeout.

Sets the timeout, in seconds, that the local or remote process will wait for a new message to be received on the protocol layer. This prevents processes from waiting indefinitely for a message.

> **NOTE:** The `protocol-timeout` option must be greater than the `db-timeout` option.

```yaml
default: 31m
allowed: [100ms, 7d]
example: --protocol-timeout=630
```

### Keep Alive Option (`--sck-keep-alive`)

Keep-alive enable.

Enables keep-alive messages on socket connections.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-sck-keep-alive
```

### Spool Path Option (`--spool-path`)

Path where transient data is stored.

This path is used to store data for the asynchronous `archive-push` and `archive-get` command.

The asynchronous `archive-push` command writes acknowledgements into the spool path when it has successfully stored WAL in the archive (and errors on failure) so the foreground process can quickly notify PostgreSQL. Acknowledgement files are very small (zero on success and a few hundred bytes on error).

The asynchronous `archive-get` command queues WAL in the spool path so it can be provided very quickly when PostgreSQL requests it. Moving files to PostgreSQL is most efficient when the spool path is on the same filesystem as `pg_xlog`/`pg_wal`. However, it is not recommended to place the spool path *within* the `pg_xlog`/`pg_wal` directory as this may cause issues for PostgreSQL utilities such as `pg_rewind`.

The data stored in the spool path is not strictly temporary since it can and should survive a reboot. However, loss of the data in the spool path is not a problem. pgBackRest will simply recheck each WAL segment to ensure it is safely archived for `archive-push` and rebuild the queue for `archive-get`.

The spool path is intended to be located on a local Posix-compatible filesystem, not a remote filesystem such as NFS or CIFS.

```yaml
default: /var/spool/pgbackrest
example: --spool-path=/backup/db/spool
```

### Stanza Option (`--stanza`)

Defines the stanza.

A stanza is the configuration for a PostgreSQL database cluster that defines where it is located, how it will be backed up, archiving options, etc. Most db servers will only have one PostgreSQL database cluster and therefore one stanza, whereas backup servers will have a stanza for every database cluster that needs to be backed up.

It is tempting to name the stanza after the primary cluster but a better name describes the databases contained in the cluster. Because the stanza name will be used for the primary and all replicas it is more appropriate to choose a name that describes the actual function of the cluster, such as app or dw, rather than the local cluster name, such as main or prod.

```yaml
example: --stanza=main
```

### Keep Alive Count Option (`--tcp-keep-alive-count`)

Keep-alive count.

Specifies the number of TCP keep-alive messages that can be lost before the connection is considered dead.

This option is available on systems that support the `TCP_KEEPCNT` socket option.

```yaml
allowed: [1, 32]
example: --tcp-keep-alive-count=3
```

### Keep Alive Idle Option (`--tcp-keep-alive-idle`)

Keep-alive idle time.

Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) with no network activity after which the operating system should send a TCP keep-alive message.

This option is available on systems that support the `TCP_KEEPIDLE` socket option.

```yaml
allowed: [1, 3600]
example: --tcp-keep-alive-idle=60
```

### Keep Alive Interval Option (`--tcp-keep-alive-interval`)

Keep-alive interval time.

Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) after which a TCP keep-alive message that has not been acknowledged should be retransmitted.

This option is available on systems that support the `TCP_KEEPINTVL` socket option.

```yaml
allowed: [1, 900]
example: --tcp-keep-alive-interval=30
```

### TLSv1.2 cipher suites Option (`--tls-cipher-12`)

Allowed TLSv1.2 cipher suites.

All TLS connections between the pgBackRest client and server are encrypted. By default, connections to objects stores (e.g. S3) are also encrypted.

> **NOTE:** The absolute minimum security level for any transport connection is TLSv1.2.

The accepted cipher suites can be adjusted if need arises. The example is reasonable choice unless you have specific security requirements. If unset (the default), the default of the underlying OpenSSL library applies.

```yaml
example: --tls-cipher-12=HIGH:MEDIUM:+3DES:!aNULL
```

### TLSv1.3 cipher suites Option (`--tls-cipher-13`)

Allowed TLSv1.3 cipher suites.

All TLS connections between the pgBackRest client and server are encrypted. By default, connections to objects stores (e.g. S3) are also encrypted.

> **NOTE:** The absolute minimum security level for any transport connection is TLSv1.2.

The accepted cipher suites can be adjusted if need arises. If unset (the default), the default of the underlying OpenSSL library applies.

```yaml
example: --tls-cipher-13=TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
```

## Log Options

### Console Log Level Option (`--log-level-console`)

Level for console logging.

The following log levels are supported:

- `off` - No logging at all (not recommended)
- `error` - Log only errors
- `warn` - Log warnings and errors
- `info` - Log info, warnings, and errors
- `detail` - Log detail, info, warnings, and errors
- `debug` - Log debug, detail, info, warnings, and errors
- `trace` - Log trace (very verbose debugging), debug, info, warnings, and errors

```yaml
default: warn
example: --log-level-console=error
```

### File Log Level Option (`--log-level-file`)

Level for file logging.

The following log levels are supported:

- `off` - No logging at all (not recommended)
- `error` - Log only errors
- `warn` - Log warnings and errors
- `info` - Log info, warnings, and errors
- `detail` - Log detail, info, warnings, and errors
- `debug` - Log debug, detail, info, warnings, and errors
- `trace` - Log trace (very verbose debugging), debug, info, warnings, and errors

```yaml
default: info
example: --log-level-file=debug
```

### Std Error Log Level Option (`--log-level-stderr`)

Level for stderr logging.

Specifies which log levels will output to `stderr` rather than `stdout` (specified by `log-level-console`). The timestamp and process will not be output to `stderr`.

The following log levels are supported:

- `off` - No logging at all (not recommended)
- `error` - Log only errors
- `warn` - Log warnings and errors
- `info` - Log info, warnings, and errors
- `detail` - Log detail, info, warnings, and errors
- `debug` - Log debug, detail, info, warnings, and errors
- `trace` - Log trace (very verbose debugging), debug, info, warnings, and errors

```yaml
default: off
example: --log-level-stderr=error
```

### Log Path Option (`--log-path`)

Path where log files are stored.

The log path provides a location for pgBackRest to store log files. Note that if `log-level-file=off` then no log path is required.

```yaml
default: /var/log/pgbackrest
example: --log-path=/backup/db/log
```

### Log Subprocesses Option (`--log-subprocess`)

Enable logging in subprocesses.

Enable file logging for any subprocesses created by this process using the log level specified by `log-level-file`.

```yaml
default: n
example: --log-subprocess
```

### Log Timestamp Option (`--log-timestamp`)

Enable timestamp in logging.

Enables the timestamp in console and file logging. This option is disabled in special situations such as generating documentation.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-log-timestamp
```

## Maintainer Options

### Check WAL Headers Option (`--archive-header-check`)

Check PostgreSQL version/id in WAL headers.

Enabled by default, this option checks the WAL header against the PostgreSQL version and system identifier to ensure that the WAL is being copied to the correct stanza. This is in addition to checking `pg_control` against the stanza and verifying that WAL is being copied from the same PostgreSQL data directory where `pg_control` is located.

Therefore, disabling this check is fairly safe but should only be done when needed, e.g. if the WAL is encrypted.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-archive-header-check
```

### Force PostgreSQL Version Option (`--pg-version-force`)

Force PostgreSQL version.

The specified PostgreSQL version will be used instead of the version automatically detected by reading `pg_control` or WAL headers. This is mainly useful for PostgreSQL forks or development versions where those values are different from the release version. The version reported by PostgreSQL via `server_version_num` must match the forced version.

WARNING:

Be cautious when using this option because `pg_control` and WAL headers will still be read with the expected format for the specified version, i.e. the format from the official open-source version of PostgreSQL. If the fork or development version changes the format of the fields that pgBackRest depends on it will lead to unexpected behavior. In general, this option will only work as expected if the fork adds all custom struct members *after* the standard PostgreSQL members.

```yaml
example: --pg-version-force=15
```

## Repository Options

### Azure Repository Container Option (`--repo-azure-container`)

Azure repository container.

Azure container used to store the repository.

pgBackRest repositories can be stored in the container root by setting `repo-path=/` but it is usually best to specify a prefix, such as `/repo`, so logs and other Azure-generated content can also be stored in the container.

```yaml
example: --repo1-azure-container=pg-backup
```

### Azure Repository Key Type Option (`--repo-azure-key-type`)

Azure repository key type.

The following types are supported for authorization:

- `shared` - Shared key
- `sas` - Shared access signature
- `auto` - Automatically authorize using Azure managed identities

```yaml
default: shared
example: --repo1-azure-key-type=sas
```

### Azure Repository URI Style Option (`--repo-azure-uri-style`)

Azure URI Style.

The following URI styles are supported:

- `host` - Connect to `account.endpoint` host.
- `path` - Connect to `endpoint` host and prepend account to URIs.

```yaml
default: host
example: --repo1-azure-uri-style=path
```

### Repository Cipher Type Option (`--repo-cipher-type`)

Cipher used to encrypt the repository.

The following cipher types are supported:

- `none` - The repository is not encrypted
- `aes-256-cbc` - Advanced Encryption Standard with 256 bit key length

Note that encryption is always performed client-side even if the repository type (e.g. S3) supports encryption.

```yaml
default: none
example: --repo1-cipher-type=aes-256-cbc
```

### GCS Repository Bucket Option (`--repo-gcs-bucket`)

GCS repository bucket.

GCS bucket used to store the repository.

pgBackRest repositories can be stored in the bucket root by setting `repo-path=/` but it is usually best to specify a prefix, such as `/repo`, so logs and other GCS-generated content can also be stored in the bucket.

```yaml
example: --repo1-gcs-bucket=/pg-backup
```

### GCS Repository Endpoint Option (`--repo-gcs-endpoint`)

GCS repository endpoint.

Endpoint used to connect to the storage service. May be updated to use a local GCS server or alternate endpoint.

```yaml
default: storage.googleapis.com
example: --repo1-gcs-endpoint=localhost

### GCS Repository Key Type Option (`--repo-gcs-key-type`)

GCS repository key type.

The following types are supported for authorization:

- `auto` - Authorize using the instance service account.
- `service` - Service account from locally stored key.
- `token` - For local testing, e.g. `fakegcs`.

When `repo-gcs-key-type=service` the credentials will be reloaded when the authentication token is renewed.

```yaml
default: service
example: --repo1-gcs-key-type=auto
```

### GCS Repository Project ID Option (`--repo-gcs-user-project`)

GCS project ID.

GCS project ID used to determine request billing.

```yaml
example: --repo1-gcs-user-project=my-project
```

When backing up and archiving to a locally mounted filesystem this setting is not required.

```yaml
example: --repo1-host=repo1.domain.com
```

Deprecated Name: backup-host

### Repository Host Certificate Authority File Option (`--repo-host-ca-file`)

Repository host certificate authority file.

Use a CA file other than the system default for connecting to the repository host.

```yaml
example: --repo1-host-ca-file=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```

### Repository Host Certificate Authority Path Option (`--repo-host-ca-path`)

Repository host certificate authority path.

Use a CA path other than the system default for connecting to the repository host.

```yaml
example: --repo1-host-ca-path=/etc/pki/tls/certs
```

### Repository Host Certificate File Option (`--repo-host-cert-file`)

Repository host certificate file.

Sent to repository host to prove client identity.

```yaml
example: --repo1-host-cert-file=/path/to/client.crt
```

### Repository Host Command Option (`--repo-host-cmd`)

Repository host pgBackRest command.

Required only if the path to the pgBackRest command is different on the local and repository hosts. If not defined, the repository host command will be set the same as the local command.

```yaml
default: [path of executed pgbackrest binary]
example: --repo1-host-cmd=/usr/lib/backrest/bin/pgbackrest
```

Deprecated Name: backup-cmd

### Repository Host Configuration Option (`--repo-host-config`)

pgBackRest repository host configuration file.

Sets the location of the configuration file on the repository host. This is only required if the repository host configuration file is in a different location than the local configuration file.

```yaml
default: CFGOPTDEF_CONFIG_PATH "/" PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE
example: --repo1-host-config=/conf/pgbackrest/pgbackrest.conf
```

Deprecated Name: backup-config

### Repository Host Configuration Include Path Option (`--repo-host-config-include-path`)

pgBackRest repository host configuration include path.

Sets the location of the configuration include path on the repository host. This is only required if the repository host configuration include path is in a different location than the local configuration include path.

```yaml
default: CFGOPTDEF_CONFIG_PATH "/" PROJECT_CONFIG_INCLUDE_PATH
example: --repo1-host-config-include-path=/conf/pgbackrest/conf.d
```

### Repository Host Configuration Path Option (`--repo-host-config-path`)

pgBackRest repository host configuration path.

Sets the location of the configuration path on the repository host. This is only required if the repository host configuration path is in a different location than the local configuration path.

```yaml
default: CFGOPTDEF_CONFIG_PATH
example: --repo1-host-config-path=/conf/pgbackrest
```

### Repository Host Key File Option (`--repo-host-key-file`)

Repository host key file.

Proves client certificate was sent by owner.

```yaml
example: --repo1-host-key-file=/path/to/client.key
```

### Repository Host Port Option (`--repo-host-port`)

Repository host port when `repo-host` is set.

Use this option to specify a non-default port for the repository host protocol.

> **NOTE:** When `repo-host-type=ssh` there is no default for `repo-host-port`. In this case the port will be whatever is configured for the command specified by `cmd-ssh`.

```yaml
default (depending on repo-host-type):
   tls - 8432

allowed: [0, 65535]
example: --repo1-host-port=25
```

Deprecated Name: backup-ssh-port

### Repository Host Protocol Type Option (`--repo-host-type`)

Repository host protocol type.

The following protocol types are supported:

- `ssh` - Secure Shell.
- `tls` - pgBackRest TLS server.

```yaml
default: ssh
example: --repo1-host-type=tls
```

### Repository Host User Option (`--repo-host-user`)

Repository host user when `repo-host` is set.

Defines the user that will be used for operations on the repository host. Preferably this is not the `postgres` user but rather some other user like `pgbackrest`. If PostgreSQL runs on the repository host the `postgres` user can be placed in the `pgbackrest` group so it has read permissions on the repository without being able to damage the contents accidentally.

```yaml
default: pgbackrest
example: --repo1-host-user=repo-user
```

Deprecated Name: backup-user

### Repository Path Option (`--repo-path`)

Path where backups and archive are stored.

The repository is where pgBackRest stores backups and archives WAL segments.

It may be difficult to estimate in advance how much space you'll need. The best thing to do is take some backups then record the size of different types of backups (full/incr/diff) and measure the amount of WAL generated per day. This will give you a general idea of how much space you'll need, though of course requirements will likely change over time as your database evolves.

```yaml
default: /var/lib/pgbackrest
example: --repo1-path=/backup/db/backrest
```

### S3 Repository Bucket Option (`--repo-s3-bucket`)

S3 repository bucket.

S3 bucket used to store the repository.

pgBackRest repositories can be stored in the bucket root by setting `repo-path=/` but it is usually best to specify a prefix, such as `/repo`, so logs and other AWS generated content can also be stored in the bucket.

```yaml
example: --repo1-s3-bucket=pg-backup
```

### S3 Repository Endpoint Option (`--repo-s3-endpoint`)

S3 repository endpoint.

The AWS endpoint should be valid for the selected region.

For custom/test configurations the `repo-storage-ca-file`, `repo-storage-ca-path`, `repo-storage-host`, `repo-storage-port`, and `repo-storage-verify-tls` options may be useful.

```yaml
example: --repo1-s3-endpoint=s3.amazonaws.com
```

### S3 Repository Key Type Option (`--repo-s3-key-type`)

S3 repository key type.

The following types are supported:

- `shared` - Shared keys
- `auto` - Automatically retrieve temporary credentials
- `web-id` - Automatically retrieve web identity credentials

```yaml
default: shared
example: --repo1-s3-key-type=auto
```

### S3 Repository KMS Key ID Option (`--repo-s3-kms-key-id`)

S3 repository KMS key.

Enables S3 server-side encryption using the specified AWS key management service key.

```yaml
example: --repo1-s3-kms-key-id=bceb4f13-6939-4be3-910d-df54dee817b7
```

### S3 Repository Region Option (`--repo-s3-region`)

S3 repository region.

The AWS region where the bucket was created.

```yaml
example: --repo1-s3-region=us-east-1
```

### S3 Repository Requestor Pays Option (`--repo-s3-requester-pays`)

S3 repository requester pays.

Enables S3 requester pays.

```yaml
default: n
example: --no-repo1-s3-requester-pays
```

### S3 Repository Role Option (`--repo-s3-role`)

S3 repository role.

The AWS role name (not the full ARN) used to retrieve temporary credentials when `repo-s3-key-type=auto`.

```yaml
example: --repo1-s3-role=authrole
```

### S3 Repository URI Style Option (`--repo-s3-uri-style`)

S3 URI Style.

The following URI styles are supported:

- `host` - Connect to `bucket.endpoint` host.
- `path` - Connect to `endpoint` host and prepend bucket to URIs.

```yaml
default: host
example: --repo1-s3-uri-style=path
```

### SFTP Repository Host Option (`--repo-sftp-host`)

SFTP repository host.

The SFTP host containing the repository.

```yaml
example: --repo1-sftp-host=sftprepo.domain
```

### SFTP Repository Host Fingerprint Option (`--repo-sftp-host-fingerprint`)

SFTP repository host fingerprint.

SFTP repository host fingerprint generation should match the `repo-sftp-host-key-hash-type`. Generate the fingerprint via `awk '{print $2}' ssh_host_xxx_key.pub | base64 -d | (md5sum or sha1sum) -b`. The ssh host keys are normally found in the `/etc/ssh` directory.

```yaml
example: --repo1-sftp-host-fingerprint=f84e172dfead7aeeeae6c1fdfb5aa8cf
```

### SFTP Host Key Check Type Option (`--repo-sftp-host-key-check-type`)

SFTP host key check type.

The following SFTP host key check types are supported:

- `strict` - pgBackRest will never automatically add host keys to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, and refuses to connect to hosts whose host key has changed or is not found in the known hosts files. This option forces the user to manually add all new hosts.
- `accept-new` - pgBackRest will automatically add new host keys to the user's known hosts file, but will not permit connections to hosts with changed host keys.
- `fingerprint` - pgBackRest will check the host key against the fingerprint specified by the `repo-sftp-host-fingerprint` option.
- `none` - no host key checking will be performed.

```yaml
default: strict
example: --repo1-sftp-host-key-check-type=accept-new
```

### SFTP Repository Host Key Hash Type Option (`--repo-sftp-host-key-hash-type`)

SFTP repository host key hash type.

SFTP repository host key hash type. Declares the hash type to be used to compute the digest of the remote system's host key on SSH startup. Newer versions of `libssh2` support `sha256` in addition to md5 and sha1.

```yaml
example: --repo1-sftp-host-key-hash-type=sha256
```

### SFTP Repository Host Port Option (`--repo-sftp-host-port`)

SFTP repository host port.

SFTP repository host port.

```yaml
default: 22
allowed: [1, 65535]
example: --repo1-sftp-host-port=22
```

### SFTP Repository Host User Option (`--repo-sftp-host-user`)

SFTP repository host user.

User on the host used to store the repository.

```yaml
example: --repo1-sftp-host-user=pg-backup
```

### SFTP Known Hosts File Option (`--repo-sftp-known-host`)

SFTP known hosts file.

A known hosts file to search for an SFTP host match during authentication. When unspecified, pgBackRest will default to searching `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, `~/.ssh/known_hosts2`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`, and `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts2`. If configured with one or more file paths, pgBackRest will search those for a match. File paths must be full or leading tilde paths. The `repo-sftp-known-host` option can be passed multiple times to specify more than one known hosts file to search. To utilize known hosts file checking `repo-sftp-host-fingerprint` must not be specified. See also `repo-sftp-host-check-type` option.

```yaml
example: --repo1-sftp-known-host=/home/postgres/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### SFTP Repository Private Key File Option (`--repo-sftp-private-key-file`)

SFTP private key file.

SFTP private key file used for authentication.

```yaml
example: --repo1-sftp-private-key-file=~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### SFTP Repository Public Key File Option (`--repo-sftp-public-key-file`)

SFTP public key file.

SFTP public key file used for authentication. Optional if compiled against OpenSSL, required if compiled against a different library.

```yaml
example: --repo1-sftp-public-key-file=~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Repository Storage CA File Option (`--repo-storage-ca-file`)

Repository storage CA file.

Use a CA file other than the system default for storage (e.g. S3, Azure) certificates.

```yaml
example: --repo1-storage-ca-file=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```

Deprecated Names: repo-azure-ca-file, repo-s3-ca-file

### Repository Storage TLS CA Path Option (`--repo-storage-ca-path`)

Repository storage CA path.

Use a CA path other than the system default for storage (e.g. S3, Azure) certificates.

```yaml
example: --repo1-storage-ca-path=/etc/pki/tls/certs
```

Deprecated Names: repo-azure-ca-path, repo-s3-ca-path

### Repository Storage Host Option (`--repo-storage-host`)

Repository storage host.

Connect to a host other than the storage (e.g. S3, Azure) endpoint. This is typically used for testing.

```yaml
example: --repo1-storage-host=127.0.0.1
```

Deprecated Names: repo-azure-host, repo-s3-host

### Repository Storage Port Option (`--repo-storage-port`)

Repository storage port.

Port to use when connecting to the storage (e.g. S3, Azure) endpoint (or host if specified).

```yaml
default: 443
allowed: [1, 65535]
example: --repo1-storage-port=9000
```

Deprecated Names: repo-azure-port, repo-s3-port

### Repository Storage Tag Option (`--repo-storage-tag`)

Repository storage tag(s).

Specify tags that will be added to objects when the repository is an object store (e.g. S3). The option can be repeated to add multiple tags.

There is no provision in pgBackRest to modify these tags so be sure to set them correctly before running `stanza-create` to ensure uniform tags across the entire repository.

```yaml
example: --repo1-storage-tag=key1=value1
```

### Repository Storage Upload Chunk Size Option (`--repo-storage-upload-chunk-size`)

Repository storage upload chunk size.

Object stores such as S3 allow files to be uploaded in chunks when the file is too large to be stored in memory. Even if the file can be stored in memory, it is more memory efficient to limit the amount of memory used for uploads.

A larger chunk size will generally lead to better performance because it will minimize upload requests and allow more files to be uploaded in a single request rather than in chunks. The disadvantage is that memory usage will be higher and because the chunk buffer must be allocated per process, larger `process-max` values will lead to more memory being consumed overall.

Note that valid chunk sizes vary by storage type and by platform. For example, AWS S3 has a minimum chunk size of 5MiB. Terminology for chunk size varies by storage type, so when searching min/max values use "part size" for AWS S3, "chunk size" for GCS, and "block size" for Azure.

If a file is larger than 1GiB (the maximum size PostgreSQL will create by default) then the chunk size will be increased incrementally up to the maximum allowed in order to complete the file upload.

```yaml
default (depending on repo-type):
   azure - 4MiB
   gcs - 4MiB
   s3 - 5MiB

allow range (depending on repo-type):
   azure - [4MiB, 1GiB]
   gcs - [4MiB, 1GiB]
   s3 - [5MiB, 1GiB]

example: --repo1-storage-upload-chunk-size=16MiB
```

### Repository Storage Certificate Verify Option (`--repo-storage-verify-tls`)

Repository storage certificate verify.

This option provides the ability to enable/disable verification of the storage (e.g. S3, Azure) server TLS certificate. Disabling should only be used for testing or other scenarios where a certificate has been self-signed.

```yaml
default: y
example: --no-repo1-storage-verify-tls
```

Deprecated Names: repo-azure-verify-tls, repo-s3-verify-ssl, repo-s3-verify-tls

### Repository Type Option (`--repo-type`)

Type of storage used for the repository.

The following repository types are supported:

- `azure` - Azure Blob Storage Service
- `cifs` - Like `posix`, but disables links and directory fsyncs
- `gcs` - Google Cloud Storage
- `posix` - Posix-compliant file systems
- `s3` - AWS Simple Storage Service
- `sftp` - Secure File Transfer Protocol

When an NFS mount is used as a `posix` repository, the same rules apply to pgBackRest as described in the PostgreSQL documentation: [Creating a Database Cluster - File Systems](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/creating-cluster.html#CREATING-CLUSTER-FILESYSTEM).

```yaml
default: posix
example: --repo1-type=cifs
```

## Stanza Options

### PostgreSQL Path Option (`--pg-path`)

PostgreSQL data directory.

This should be the same as the `data_directory` reported by PostgreSQL. Even though this value can be read from various places, it is prudent to set it in case those resources are not available during a restore or offline backup scenario.

The `pg-path` option is tested against the value reported by PostgreSQL on every online backup so it should always be current.

```yaml
example: --pg1-path=/data/db
```

Deprecated Name: db-path
