# API Reference

LLMS index: [llms.txt](/llms.txt)

---

`pg_exporter` exposes four kinds of HTTP endpoints on its listen port (default `:9630`): metrics, health checks, traffic routing, and operational management. The full endpoint list:

| Endpoint                       | Method   | Description                 |
|--------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| [`/metrics`](#get-metrics)     | GET      | Prometheus metrics endpoint (path configurable via `--web.telemetry-path`) |
| [`/up`](#health-checks)        | GET      | Aliveness check; aliases `/health`, `/liveness`, `/readiness`, `/read` |
| [`/primary`](#traffic-routing) | GET      | Primary check; aliases `/leader`, `/master`, `/read-write`, `/rw` |
| [`/replica`](#traffic-routing) | GET      | Replica check; aliases `/standby`, `/slave`, `/read-only`, `/ro` |
| [`/reload`](#operational-endpoints) | GET/POST | Hot-reload collector configuration |
| [`/explain`](#operational-endpoints) | GET      | Show per-collector planning decisions |
| [`/stat`](#operational-endpoints)    | GET      | Per-collector runtime statistics (hits / errors / duration) |
| `/version`                     | GET      | Version and build information (plain text) |
| `/`                            | GET      | Landing page linking to the metrics endpoint |
{.full-width}

Health and routing endpoints answer from a cached background-probe role state (`primary` / `replica` / `down` / `starting` / `unknown`) — they never query the database synchronously per HTTP request, so probe storms cannot reach the database.


--------

## Metrics Endpoint

### GET /metrics

The primary endpoint that exposes all collected metrics in Prometheus format.

#### Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:9630/metrics
```

#### Response

```prometheus
# HELP pg_up last scrape was able to connect to the server: 1 for yes, 0 for no
# TYPE pg_up gauge
pg_up 1

# HELP pg_version server version number
# TYPE pg_version gauge
pg_version 140000

# HELP pg_in_recovery server is in recovery mode? 1 for yes 0 for no
# TYPE pg_in_recovery gauge
pg_in_recovery 0

# HELP pg_exporter_build_info A metric with a constant '1' value labeled with version, revision, branch, goversion, builddate, goos, and goarch from which pg_exporter was built.
# TYPE pg_exporter_build_info gauge
pg_exporter_build_info{version="v1.4.1",branch="main",revision="<git-sha>",builddate="<build-date>",goversion="go1.26.5",goos="linux",goarch="amd64"} 1

# ... additional metrics
```

#### Response Format

Metrics follow the Prometheus exposition format:

```text
# HELP <metric_name> <description>
# TYPE <metric_name> <type>
<metric_name>{<label_name>="<label_value>",...} <value> <timestamp>
```

#### Self-Monitoring Metrics

Besides business metrics defined by YAML collectors, `/metrics` also exposes the exporter's own runtime metrics (disable the `pg_exporter_*` part with `--disable-intro`; the prefix follows `--namespace` and becomes `pgbouncer_` in pgBouncer mode):

| Metric | Labels | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `pg_up` | — | 1 when the target database is reachable, 0 otherwise |
| `pg_version` | — | Server version in `server_version_num` format |
| `pg_in_recovery` | — | 1 when in recovery mode (replica) |
| `pg_exporter_build_info` | version, revision, ... | Constant 1 with build info in labels |
| `pg_exporter_up` | — | Constant 1 while the exporter is alive |
| `pg_exporter_uptime` | — | Seconds since the exporter started |
| `pg_exporter_scrape_total_count` / `_error_count` | — | Cumulative scrape / failure counts |
| `pg_exporter_scrape_duration` | — | Duration of the last scrape in seconds |
| `pg_exporter_last_scrape_time` | — | Timestamp of the last scrape |
| `pg_exporter_server_scrape_*` | datname | Per-database scrape duration and success/failure counters |
| `pg_exporter_query_scrape_duration` | datname, query | Last execution duration per collector |
| `pg_exporter_query_scrape_total_count` / `_error_count` | datname, query | Execution / failure counts per collector |
| `pg_exporter_query_scrape_hit_count` / `_metric_count` | datname, query | Rows returned / metrics emitted per collector |
| `pg_exporter_query_scrape_predicate_skip_count` | datname, query | Times skipped because a predicate returned false |
| `pg_exporter_query_cache_ttl` | datname, query | Result cache TTL per collector |
{.full-width}

`pg_exporter_query_scrape_duration` and `_error_count` pinpoint slow and failing collectors directly — the machine-readable equivalent of `/stat`.


--------

## Health Checks

Health endpoints provide multiple ways to monitor PG Exporter and the target database state.

### GET /up

Simple aliveness check based on cached background probe state. It does not actively probe the database on every HTTP request.

#### Response Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 200  | OK     | Target is available (`primary` / `replica`) |
| 503  | Service Unavailable | Target is unavailable (`down` / `starting` / `unknown`) |
{.full-width}

#### Example

```bash
# Check whether the service is healthy
curl -I http://localhost:9630/up

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

### GET /health

Alias of `/up` with identical behavior.

```bash
curl http://localhost:9630/health
```

### GET /liveness and GET /readiness

Path aliases provided for Kubernetes probe conventions, with behavior identical to `/up` (same handler):

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /liveness, port: 9630 }
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
readinessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /readiness, port: 9630 }
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

Note that both share the same semantics: they return 503 when the target database is unreachable. If you don't want "database down" to restart the exporter Pod, use a TCP probe on the listen port for liveness instead.


--------

## Traffic Routing

These endpoints are designed for load balancers and proxies to route traffic based on server role.

### GET /primary

Check whether the server is a primary instance.

#### Response Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 200  | OK     | Server is primary and accepting writes |
| 404  | Not Found | Server is not primary and is acting as a replica |
| 503  | Service Unavailable | Server is unavailable (`down` / `starting` / `unknown`) |
{.full-width}

#### Aliases

- `/leader`
- `/master`
- `/read-write`
- `/rw`

#### Example

```bash
# Check whether the server is primary
curl -I http://localhost:9630/primary

# Use in HAProxy
backend pg_primary
  option httpchk GET /primary
  server pg1 10.0.0.1:5432 check port 9630
  server pg2 10.0.0.2:5432 check port 9630
```

### GET /replica

Check whether the server is a replica instance.

#### Response Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 200  | OK     | Server is a replica and in recovery |
| 404  | Not Found | Server is not a replica and is acting as primary |
| 503  | Service Unavailable | Server is unavailable (`down` / `starting` / `unknown`) |
{.full-width}

#### Aliases

- `/standby`
- `/read-only`
- `/ro`

`/slave` remains compatible, but `/replica` is the preferred name.

#### Example

```bash
# Check whether the server is a replica
curl -I http://localhost:9630/replica

# Use in a load balancer
backend pg_replicas
  option httpchk GET /replica
  server pg2 10.0.0.2:5432 check port 9630
  server pg3 10.0.0.3:5432 check port 9630
```

### GET /read

Check whether the server can handle read traffic. Both primaries and replicas may return success.

#### Response Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 200  | OK     | Server is healthy and can handle reads |
| 503  | Service Unavailable | Server is unavailable (`down` / `starting` / `unknown`) |
{.full-width}

#### Example

```bash
# Check whether the server can serve reads
curl -I http://localhost:9630/read

# Route reads to any healthy server
backend pg_read
  option httpchk GET /read
  server pg1 10.0.0.1:5432 check port 9630
  server pg2 10.0.0.2:5432 check port 9630
  server pg3 10.0.0.3:5432 check port 9630
```


--------

## Operational Endpoints

### GET /reload / POST /reload

Reload configuration without restarting the exporter.

#### Request

```bash
# POST is recommended
curl -X POST http://localhost:9630/reload

# GET remains supported for compatibility
curl http://localhost:9630/reload
```

#### Response

```text
server reloaded
```

#### Response Codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 200  | OK     | Reload completed successfully |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Reload failed and returns `fail to reload: ...` |
| 405  | Method Not Allowed | Non-GET/POST request, with `Allow: GET, POST` |
{.full-width}

#### Use Cases

- Update collector definitions
- Change query parameters
- Modify cache TTL values
- Add or remove collectors

> [!NOTE] Note
> Reload refreshes collector configuration and query plans. Process-level settings such as listen addresses and CLI arguments still require a restart.

> [!WARNING] Security Advice
> `/reload`, `/explain`, and `/stat` are management endpoints. If the exporter is reachable beyond localhost or a trusted private network, protect them with `--web.config.file` or restrict access at the reverse proxy or firewall layer.

### GET /explain

Display planned collector execution details for all configured collectors.

#### Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:9630/explain
```

#### Response

```text
##

#       pg.pg_primary_only_*
#
# DESCRIPTION
#       PostgreSQL basic information (on primary)
#
# OPTIONS

...
```

### GET /stat

Show runtime statistics, including collector execution times and success/error counters.

#### Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:9630/stat
```

#### Response

```text
name                     total      hit        error      skip       metric     ttl/s  duration/ms

pg_db                    12         11         0          0          28         10     0.153000
pg_activity              12         0          1          0          8          0      7.842000
...
```

This endpoint is useful when identifying slow or problematic collectors.

## Using with Load Balancers

### HAProxy Example

```haproxy
# Primary backend for write traffic
backend pg_primary
  mode tcp
  option httpchk GET /primary
  http-check expect status 200
  server pg1 10.0.0.1:5432 check port 9630 inter 3000 fall 2 rise 2
  server pg2 10.0.0.2:5432 check port 9630 inter 3000 fall 2 rise 2 backup

# Replica backend for read traffic
backend pg_replicas
  mode tcp
  balance roundrobin
  option httpchk GET /replica
  http-check expect status 200
  server pg2 10.0.0.2:5432 check port 9630 inter 3000 fall 2 rise 2
  server pg3 10.0.0.3:5432 check port 9630 inter 3000 fall 2 rise 2

# Read backend for any server that can handle reads
backend pg_read
  mode tcp
  balance leastconn
  option httpchk GET /read
  http-check expect status 200
  server pg1 10.0.0.1:5432 check port 9630 inter 3000 fall 2 rise 2
  server pg2 10.0.0.2:5432 check port 9630 inter 3000 fall 2 rise 2
  server pg3 10.0.0.3:5432 check port 9630 inter 3000 fall 2 rise 2
```

### A Note on Nginx

Open-source Nginx does not support active out-of-band HTTP health checks (the `health_check` directive is an NGINX Plus feature), and PostgreSQL traffic requires the `stream` module rather than `http` proxying. For role-based PostgreSQL traffic routing, prefer HAProxy as shown above, or solutions like Patroni + vip-manager.
